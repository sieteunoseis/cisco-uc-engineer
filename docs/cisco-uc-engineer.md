Cisco Unified Communications engineer skill for AI agents. Orchestrates [cisco-axl](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-axl), [cisco-dime](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-dime), [cisco-perfmon](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-perfmon), [cisco-risport](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-risport), and [cisco-support](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-support) for UC troubleshooting, provisioning, monitoring, and lifecycle management.

## What is this?

This is a **meta-skill** — it doesn't have its own CLI. Instead, it teaches AI agents how to use multiple Cisco UC CLI tools together to solve cross-domain problems like:

- Phone not registering? Check config (axl) → check registration (risport) → pull traces (dime)
- Call quality issues? Check performance counters (perfmon) → pull SIP traces (dime)
- Audit investigation? Pull audit logs (dime) → check current config (axl)
- Pre-upgrade research? Check bugs (support) → check EoX (support) → compare versions (support)
- Syslog errors? Pull syslogs (dime) → search known bugs (support)

## Installation

### 1. Install the CLI tools you need

```bash
npm install -g cisco-axl      # CUCM configuration
npm install -g cisco-dime      # CUCM log collection
npm install -g cisco-perfmon   # Performance counters
npm install -g cisco-risport   # Device registration
npm install -g cisco-support   # Bugs, EoX, PSIRT, software, warranty
```

### 2. Install the skill

```bash
npx skills add sieteunoseis/cisco-uc-engineer --skill cisco-uc-engineer
```

The skill auto-detects which CLI tools are installed and adapts workflows accordingly. You don't need all five — install what you need.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | npm |
|---|---|---|
| [cisco-axl](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-axl) | CUCM configuration — phones, lines, route patterns, CSS, SIP trunks | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cisco-axl)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cisco-axl) |
| [cisco-dime](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-dime) | CUCM log collection — SIP traces, SDL, audit logs | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cisco-dime)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cisco-dime) |
| [cisco-perfmon](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-perfmon) | Real-time performance counters — CPU, memory, call stats | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cisco-perfmon)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cisco-perfmon) |
| [cisco-risport](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-risport) | Device registration status — phone reg, CTI, trunk status | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cisco-risport)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cisco-risport) |
| [cisco-support](https://github.com/sieteunoseis/cisco-support) | Cisco Support APIs — bugs, EoX, PSIRT, software, warranty | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cisco-support)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cisco-support) |

## Troubleshooting Workflows

### Phone Not Registering

```bash
cisco-axl get Phone --name SEP001122334455 --format json
cisco-risport query --mac 001122334455
cisco-dime select sip-traces --last 30m --download
```

### Call Routing Issue

```bash
cisco-axl sql query "SELECT dnorpattern, routePartitionName FROM numplan WHERE dnorpattern LIKE '%1001%'"
cisco-axl get CallingSearchSpace --name CSS_INTERNAL --format json
cisco-dime select sip-traces --last 1h --download
```

### Call Quality / One-Way Audio

```bash
cisco-perfmon collect "Cisco CallManager" --counter "CallsActive,RegisteredHardwarePhones"
cisco-risport query --mac 001122334455
cisco-dime select sip-traces --last 30m --download
```

### Performance Investigation

```bash
cisco-perfmon collect "Cisco CallManager" --counter "RegisteredHardwarePhones,CallsActive,CallsAttempted,CallsCompleted"
cisco-perfmon collect "Processor" --counter "% CPU Time"
cisco-risport summary
cisco-dime select syslog --last 1h
```

### Audit / Change Investigation

```bash
cisco-dime select audit --last 1d --download
cisco-axl get Phone --name SEP001122334455 --format json
```

## Diagnostic Decision Tree

When a problem is reported, follow this order:

1. **Is it registered to CUCM?** → `cisco-risport query --mac <mac>`
2. **Is the config correct?** → `cisco-axl get Phone --name <name>`
3. **What do the logs show?** → `cisco-dime select sip-traces --last 30m`
4. **Is the system healthy?** → `cisco-perfmon collect "Cisco CallManager" --counter "CallsActive"`
5. **Are there known bugs?** → `cisco-support bug search --keyword "<error>"`
6. **Is the hardware end-of-life?** → `cisco-support eox --pid <model>`

Start broad, narrow down. Don't pull traces until you've checked the basics.
